Re-imagining of Wheresmyb.us into an Android app.

The goal of this app is to be able to retrieve all ETAs under 30 minutes for CTS bus stops in Corvallis, Oregon.

Users can select a route and see a list of stops and their ETA, organized by ETA from smallest to largest.

As of now, updating is on-demand via the REFRESH button.
